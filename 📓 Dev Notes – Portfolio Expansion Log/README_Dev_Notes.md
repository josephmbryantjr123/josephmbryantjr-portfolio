# 🛠️ Dev Notes: Portfolio Engineering Log

Welcome to the **Dev Notes** section of my professional portfolio. This folder serves as the behind-the-scenes logbook documenting the iterative build process, strategic decision-making, issue resolution, and creative breakthroughs that brought this portfolio to life.

Each entry is time-stamped and grouped by working session, reflecting a transparent view into my engineering mindset, ability to adapt, and commitment to excellence through versioning, feedback loops, and continuous improvement.

These logs capture:
- Strategic design decisions
- Workflow adaptations and technical problem solving
- Asset versioning and README iterations
- Collaboration with simulated AI personas
- Developer-style documentation aligned with product management best practices

This section is intentionally excluded from the live portfolio showcase but is designed for future expansion into full-featured documentation or case studies if desired.
