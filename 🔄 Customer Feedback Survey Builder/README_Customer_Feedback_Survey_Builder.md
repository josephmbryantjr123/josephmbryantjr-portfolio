# ðŸ”„ Customer Feedback Survey Builder

## Overview
This project showcases a lightweight, AI-assisted survey builder tool designed to help startups, small businesses, and product teams gather actionable feedback in minutes. It was developed to support trust-building, customer obsession, and iterative product refinementâ€”all core leadership principles demonstrated in this portfolio.

The Customer Feedback Survey Builder enables users to dynamically generate survey templates, adapt tone by customer segment, and collect responses via embeddable links or QR codes. This project is not just about UX, but about how insights are collected, interpreted, and turned into innovation.

## Problem
Startups often fail to collect meaningful customer insights early enough. Generic survey tools lack context, flexibility, or intelligence. Many teams postpone feedback loops, resulting in missed opportunities, lack of trust, and product-market misalignment.

## Solution
This builder introduces AI-generated surveys tailored by product type, customer sentiment, and brand voice. It prioritizes clarity, brevity, and actionable results. This solution streamlines a critical but often neglected part of product development.
