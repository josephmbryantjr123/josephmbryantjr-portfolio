# üèîÔ∏è Big Bear Dream Trip Planner

### Project Overview
The **Big Bear Dream Trip Planner** was designed to enhance travel experience planning using a blend of user-driven intent, AI-powered assistance, and itinerary visualization. Inspired by real trip preparation, this project provided hands-on experience crafting user flow, prompt frameworks, and task structure tailored for mobile-first engagement.

### Key Contributions

- Built prompt logic to simulate user choices (e.g., ‚Äúromantic weekend‚Äù, ‚Äúsnowboard family trip‚Äù, etc.).
- Balanced playful tone with user-centric delivery for both mockup and prompt output alignment.
- Created framework for adding maps, lodging, dining, and weather forecast integrations.

### Learning Outcomes
- Refined ability to distill ambiguous user goals into structured assistant flows.
- Practiced user journey storytelling within a limited visual prompt canvas.
- Aligned prompt behavior with user expectations in real-world travel planning.
